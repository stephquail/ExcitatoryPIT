##This script extracts and summarises Instrumental training data from the excitatory PIT task. 
##Before you run this you need:
#The log files for each participant in the 'R/data' folder
#Participant log files all named '(whateveryouridsis)_instru.log'

#-if you try to run this without the appropriate packages installed it wont work
#-you can use install.packages() to download these
#-this may take a bit of fiddling if your uni's firewall doesn't like you doing this
#You will need to create individual participant ID vectors in the 'R/functions.R' script 

library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(stringr)
source("R/functions.R") #this loads the functions that will be needed for analysis
